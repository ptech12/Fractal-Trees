# Fractal-Trees  ![Fractal Tree](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ptech12/Fractal-Trees/main/image.png)

### Recursive Fractel Tree using javascript and p5.js. I got this project idea by seeing [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0jjeOYMjmDU)
#### You can download this file and run directly into your browser. But you need p5.js, you can get them [here](https://p5js.org/download/)
#### You can also directly run the js file by using the [p5.js Web Editor](https://editor.p5js.org/)
##### If you like my version of Fractal Tree, you can help me by sharing your ideas and contributing it. I hope you do :)
